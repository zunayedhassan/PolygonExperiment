# Polygon Experiment
My experiment on various 2D shapes

## Object to Polygon Converter

This program converts various shapes (such as Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Rounded Rectangle) and Curves (such as Bézier Cubic curve and Bézier Quadratic curve) to paths

To get about how things done, please visit PolygonExperiment/PolygonConverter/src/zunayedhassan/PolygonConverterExperiment/Model/ShapeToPolygonConverter.java file

## Vertex Sorting
Sorts randomly positioned vertices to clockwise or counter clockwise order

The algorithm is in PolygonExperiment/VertexSorting/src/zunayedhassan/VertexSorting/Model/VertexSortingHelper.java file

## Lasso Tool Example
Implementation of Lasso Tool on JavaFX

### Usage ###
Just look at the ```FreeHandSelector.java``` file and you will fugure this out.
