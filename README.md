# Polygon Experiment
My experiment on various 2D shapes

## Object to Polygon Converter

This program converts various shapes (such as Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Rounded Rectangle) and Curves (such as Bézier Cubic curve and Bézier Quadratic curve) to paths

To get about how things done, please visit PolygonExperiment/PolygonConverter/src/zunayedhassan/PolygonConverterExperiment/Model/ShapeToPolygonConverter.java file
